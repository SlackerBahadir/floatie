# 🐈 floatie

**Floatie**, is an open-source desktop pet platform that lets you add animated characters to your screen — from cats to custom creatures. Lightweight, fun, and fully customizable.

> This repository is **under DEVELOPMENT**. You can see codes that don't work at all or are half functional, half non-functional. Or nothing at all?


## 🔧 Things I want to add

- 😼 **Customizable pets!**
- 🌌 **Multi-OS support!** (There are too many alternatives for Windows but I am gonna do best for my Linux using fellas.)
- 🚶 **Walking, running, idle and more animation support!**
- 🧠 **AI generated chatting with your pets!**
and more...
